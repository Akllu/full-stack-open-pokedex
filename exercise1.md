# Exercise 11.1
 - Let's say that our team works with Python. For linting/formatting the code we could use Pylint or Flake8. To test our code we could use Robot Framework, Pytest or Unittest. We don't need to worry about building because Python is interpreted language so the "build" mainly revolves around test execution rather than compilation. Since our build is automated and everyone in our team is committing changes frequently it's much easier to locate bugs and conflicts. And even if someone would forget to test the changes locally, we can live without worry when our tests are running automatically.
 - Since we can't use GitHub Actions, we would use some other cloud-based platform like CircleCI, Travis CI or Spinnaker. Alternatively, we could use Atlassian Bamboo instead of Jenkins if we want to configure the CI/CD by ourselves.
 - Let's say our application is small and with our dev team being about 6 people, I would definitely stick to any cloud-based platform since we really don't want to spend our time configuring things by ourselves. Another good point is that we remain much more scalable when using cloud services making changes easier to make. I would reconsider the situation as our team or application grows.
